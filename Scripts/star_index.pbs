# Description: Prepare a reference genome for mapping with STAR
# Usage: Replace <> with your project requirements and where specified.
# Adjust compute resources using the guide below. Then:
# qsub star_index.pbs
# Job resource requirements:Human/mouse genomes require at least 
# 6CPU, 64Gb memory (E ~ 0.92)
# Do not use less than 64Gb for these and similar genomes
# walltime=02:00:00 (job expected to complete in ~0.5 hour)
# Queue: express is recommended. It's a small job and the time
# saved in queue is worth it!

#PBS -P <project>
#PBS -N star_index
#PBS -l walltime=02:00:00,ncpus=9,mem=64GB,wd
#PBS -q normal
#PBS -W umask=022
#PBS -l storage=scratch/<project>
#PBS -o ./Logs/star_index.o
#PBS -e ./Logs/star_index.e

# Load modules
